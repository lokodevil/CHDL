# CHDL
C.H. File Downloader. Free.

Update: this seems to have gotten more popular than expected. 

This was only a small project to learn more about making chrome extensions but I am getting too many requests over many social media platforms and e-mail. 

I have closed the issues on this repository as I am not providing support for this plugin - it was never intended for any sort of release.

This script was hastily concocted. CHDL is a Chrome Extension that attempts to download full (unblurred) documents from Course Hero.

## Installation
The extension must be installed in Chrome's developer mode.

## Usage
You must be on a document page on C.H. to use the extension from either the toolbar or the right-click context menu, and you must be signed in on the CourseHero website.

The extension works due to a weird permission error on C.H.'s end that fails to check what files users should be able to access.

Singular file downloads seem to have a very high success rate when the entire document is shown (even if most pages are blurred).

Try out the "Download all files from this course." option to start downloading relevant files - it shouldn't be more than a handful.
